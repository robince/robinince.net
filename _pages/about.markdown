## Bio

I was born in Germany but grew up on the island of [Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) and have dual British and US citizenship.
I studied [Mathematics](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/depta2z/maths/g103) at the University of Warwick, [Audio Acoustics](http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/courses/?content=msc_aa) at the University of Salford, spent a semester in [North Carolina](http://www.ncsu.edu/) and 18 months working in [industry](http://www.redprairie.com/) before returning to study [Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/postgraduate/taughtdegrees/courses/atoz/course/?code=05951&pg=2) in Manchester. 

I am currently working as a postdoc in the [Logothetis group](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/research/dep/lo.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://www.kyb.mpg.de/), where I work with [Nikos Logothetis](http://www.kyb.mpg.de/~nikos) and [Stefano Panzeri](http://www.iit.it/en/people.html?view=profile&layout=profile&id=289) analysing data from neurological signals.
Before this, I did my PhD in the Petersen lab at the University of Manchester. For my PhD I was jointly supervised by [Rasmus Petersen](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/r.petersen/) (University of Manchester) and [Stefano Panzeri](http://www.iit.it/en/people.html?view=profile&layout=profile&id=289) (IIT, Genoa).
