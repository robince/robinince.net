## Bio

I was born in Germany but grew up on the island of [Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) and have dual British and US citizenship.
I studied [Mathematics](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/depta2z/maths/g103) at the University of Warwick, [Audio Acoustics](http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/courses/?content=msc_aa) at the University of Salford, spent a semester in [North Carolina](http://www.ncsu.edu/) and 18 months working in [industry](http://www.redprairie.com/) before returning to study [Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/postgraduate/taughtdegrees/courses/atoz/course/?code=05951&pg=2) in Manchester. 

I am currently working as a postdoc in the [Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/) at the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/), where I work with [Stefano Panzeri](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/stefanopanzeri/) analysing data from neurological signals.
Before this, I worked as a postdoc at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://www.kyb.mpg.de/) and before that I did my PhD in the Petersen lab at the University of Manchester. For my PhD I was jointly supervised by [Rasmus Petersen](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/r.petersen/) and [Stefano Panzeri](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/stefanopanzeri/).
