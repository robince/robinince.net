## Bio

I am currently working as a research associate in the [Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/) at the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/), developing methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data.
Before this, I worked at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://www.kyb.mpg.de/) and before that I did my PhD in the Petersen lab at the University of Manchester. For my PhD I was supervised by [Rasmus Petersen](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/r.petersen/) and [Stefano Panzeri](http://www.iit.it/en/people/stefano-panzeri.html).

I was born in Germany but grew up on the island of [Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) and have dual British and US citizenship.
I studied [Mathematics](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/g103/) at the University of Warwick, [Audio Acoustics](http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/courses/?content=msc_aa) at the University of Salford, spent a semester in [North Carolina](http://www.ncsu.edu/) and 18 months working in [industry](http://www.redprairie.com/) before returning to academia to study [Computational Neuroscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) in Manchester.
