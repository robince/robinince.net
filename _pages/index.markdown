I am a postdoc in the [Logothetis group](http://www.kyb.mpg.de/lo/index.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](http://www.kyb.mpg.de/). On this site you can find out about my [research](research.html), get an idea about some of my [interests](links.html) and download some [code](code.html) that I have produced.

## Background

I was born in Germany but grew up on the island of [Jersey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) and have dual British and US citizenship. I studied [Mathematics](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/depta2z/maths/g103) at the University of Warwick, [Audio Acoustics](http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/courses/?content=msc_aa) at the University of Salford, spent a semester in [North Carolina](http://www.ncsu.edu/) and 18 months working in [industry](http://www.redprairie.com/) before returning to study [Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/postgraduate/taughtdegrees/courses/atoz/course/?code=05951&pg=2) in Manchester. 
I went on to do my PhD in Manchester, on information theoretic approaches to neural coding in the rodent somatosensory system, before moving to TÃ¼bingen to work at the MPI.
