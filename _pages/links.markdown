###<a name="ln"></a>Lectures/Notes

* [Spike Train Analysis Network - Online seminars](http://www.spiketrain.org/Seminars.html) : a range of seminars that take place live online (you can email questions etc.) but are also archived for later viewing.
* [Statistical analysis of neural data](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/teaching/neurostat-spr09/) : learning materials available online for a course taught at Columbia by [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/).

##<a name="software"></a>Software
Here is a list of some software I use regularly.

* <strike>I have been happily Windows free for some time now,</strike> I use [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) on a laptop, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) on workstations I can control, and [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/) on servers which I do not control.
* I primarily use the [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) variant of the [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) editor.
* For version control I now use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) primarily, but have in the past used [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) and [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/).
* I use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), with [Pentadactyl](http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/) (vim-style key bindings) and [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) (bibliographic database).
* I work a lot in the [iTerm2 terminal](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) which is a more actively developed fork of iTerm.
* For remote access to workstations and servers I use [NoMachine NX](http://www.nomachine.com/) and [CoRD](http://cord.sourceforge.net/).
* For document preparation I prefer to use LaTex via the [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) distribution.
* I built this website with [Blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com/) using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* While I prefer Python (see below) it would be remiss not to include a link to [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/index.html), which I am using more often at the moment.
* Other day to day essentials include [Skype](http://www.skype.com/), [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) and last but by no means least [QuickSilver](http://www.blacktree.com/).


###<a name="python"></a>Python
The Python programming language, together with the numerical libraries NumPy and SciPy provide a compelling alternative to MATLAB for scientific computation.

* The [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language.
* The numerical libraries [NumPy and SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/). 
* The [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) plotting package.
* The [IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) interactive interpreter.
* The [Cython](http://cython.org/) language.
* There are some bundled installers which include everything you need, such as [Python(x,y)](http://www.pythonxy.com/) (windows, quite current) and [EPD](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php) (cross platform, commercial but free for academic use).
* You can find some information about the advantages of Python [here](http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html). I also like these examples of how easy it is to [improve performance](http://www.scipy.org/PerformancePython) and to [parallelise](http://www.scipy.org/ParallelProgramming) your code.

##<a name="other"></a>Other Stuff

* I like playing acoustic guitar. [fingerstyleblues.com](http://www.fingerstyleblues.com/) is a site with some really nice beginner fingerstyle exercises and [classtab.org](http://www.classtab.org/) is a great resource for classical guitar tab.
